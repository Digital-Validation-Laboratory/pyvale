class ISensorArray(ABC):
    """Interface (abstract base class) for an array of sensors of the same
    type sampling a given physical field.

    This class implements the `pyvale` sensor measurement simulation model. Here
    a measurement is taken as: measurement = truth + random errors + systematic
    errors. The truth value for each sensor is interpolated from the physical
    field (an implementation of the `IField` interface, nominally a
    `FieldScalar`, `FieldVector` or `FieldTensor` object).

    The random and systematic errors are calculated by a user specified error
    integrator (`ErrIntegrator` class). This class contains a chain of different
    types of user selected errors (implementations of the `IErrCalculator`
    interface). Further information can be found in the `ErrIntegrator` class
    and in implementations of the `IErrCalculator` interface.

    In `pyvale`, function and methods with `calc` in their name will cause
    probability distributions to be resampled and any additional calculations,
    such as interpolation, to be performed. Functions and methods with `get` in
    the name will directly return the previously calculated values without
    resampling probability distributions.

    Calling the class method `calc_measurements()` will create and return an
    array of simulated sensor measurements with the following shape=(num_sensors
    ,num_field_component,num_time_steps). When calling `calc_measurements()` all
    sensor errors that are based on probability distributions are resampled and
    any required interpolations are performed (e.g. a random perturbation of the
    sensor positions requiring interpolation at the perturbed sensor location).

    Calling the class method `get_measurements()` just returns the previously
    calculated set of sensor measurements without resampling of probability.
    Distributions.

    Without an error integrator this class can be used for interpolating
    simulated physical fields quickly using finite element shape functions.
